# Pokemon Dataset Visualization: Some visualizations of Pokemon dataset
Notebook for couple of visualizations of the Pokemon dataset. Contains visualizations like bar, histogram, scatter and line plots.
Source for the dataset in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon

### Libraries Used
For visualizations, I've used Numpy and Pandas for the data processing, Matplotlib for chart plotting and a bit of sugar to balance all of this.
