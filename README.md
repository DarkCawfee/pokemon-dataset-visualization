# Pokemon Dataset Visualization: Visualization of Pokemon dataset
A simple python script to run a visualization of the HP and Defense of Pokemon using Pandas and Matplotlib.
Source of the dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon

### Libraries Used
For visualizations, I've used Pandas for the data processing, Matplotlib for chart plotting and a bit of sugar to balance all of this.
